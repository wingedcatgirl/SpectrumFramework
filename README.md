# SpectrumFramework
A mod for Balatro that adds Spectrum hands (five cards, each of a different suit), for use alongside mods that add suits.

Does _not_ add any additional suits of its own. If you install this mod by itself, playing Spectrum hands will require the use of Wild cards. But hey, maybe that's something you want to do.

Probably don't use this with mods that already add Spectrum hands! I don't know what will happen if you do that! I'd put them in the .json as conflicts but that stops them from even being installed, including if you turn them off, which seems weird and inconvenient.

## Things planned to definitely do:
- Planets for the hands

## Things planned to probably do
- Jokers for the hands

## Things planned to possibly maybe do
- Art for the planets which isn't a hilariously blatant placeholder
- Figure out what to do about the conflicts thing
