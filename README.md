# SpectrumFramework
A mod for Balatro that adds Spectrum hands (five cards, each of a different suit), for use alongside mods that add suits.

Does _not_ add any additional suits of its own. If you install this mod by itself, playing Spectrum hands will require the use of Wild cards. But hey, maybe that's something you want to do.

Also allows Smeared Joker to make all modded suits count as the same suit, if you want to do that.

<details>
  <summary>Config Options</summary>
<ul>
<li>Spectrum Score Status: Standard (always use lower chips+mult values and hand ranking), Situational (attempt to detect which values should be used based on starting deck), or Special (always use higher chips+mult values and hand ranking)</li>
<li>Specflush hands:</li> Enable WIP hands containing both a Spectrum and a Flush
<li>Smear modded suits: Default false. Modifies Smeared Joker to also make all modded suits count as each other. Recommended if you think this sounds like a fun idea.</li>
<li>Dev messages: Sends trace-level dev messages to the console. If you don't know what this means, it's not relevant to you.</li>
<li>Joker and Planet designs: Switch between CupertinoEffect's art, my original very silly doodles, or the art from <a href="https://github.com/Aurelius7309/SixSuits">Six Suits</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jumbocarrot0/Bunco">Bunco</a>. Y'know, in case you really like a specific version.</li>

## Things done:
- The hands
- Planets for the hands
- Jokers for the hands
- Alternate lower score values for decks that make Spectra very easy to build (e.g. Cryptid's The Lovers deck, or a deck that starts with five or more suits)
  - If your mod has a deck that should use these lower score values, have it set `G.GAME.starting_params.easy_spectra` to true. (Example: [Deck with a Treat](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/MintysSillyMod/blob/b2c926aef8fca1a08b2a29ac98c0e433363681c4/backs/backs.lua#L11) from Minty's Silly Little Mod)
  - The mod will also try to count suits at the beginning of the run, but it's known to have some issues currently (e.g. with Cryptid's The Lovers deck)
  - A non-zero number of decks are just force-detected. Guess which deck from Cryptid is one of them.

## Things planned to probably do
- Fix the suit-counting thing (figure out a way to make it happen later, probably)

## Things planned to possibly do
- Art switch on a per-item basis (UI design [is my passion](https://web.archive.org/web/20141027160015/http://avdol.co.vu/post/91095908541))

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Toggling or updating Spectrum Framework mid-run will probably crash your game when you continue. Generally speaking, you should start a new run when your mod loadout changes in any way.

## Attribution
- A lot of this code came from [Bunco](https://github.com/jumbocarrot0/Bunco), which in turn got it from [Six Suits](https://github.com/lshtech/SixSuits).

## Compatibility
The following mods implement Spectrum themself but ensure non-redundancy on their end, so there's no problem loading them together:
- Paperback
- Six Suits

The following mod has not been _thoroughly_ tested, but we've tried working things out on our end, so [tell us](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/SpectrumFramework/issues) if something weird happens:
- Bunco
