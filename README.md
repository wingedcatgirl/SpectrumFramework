# SpectrumFramework
A mod for Balatro that adds Spectrum hands (five cards, each of a different suit), for use alongside mods that add suits.

Does _not_ add any additional suits of its own. If you install this mod by itself, playing Spectrum hands will require the use of Wild cards. But hey, maybe that's something you want to do.

## Compatibility
Redundant to and therefore will not load with the following mods:
- Bunco
- SixSuits
